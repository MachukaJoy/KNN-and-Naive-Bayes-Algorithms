# KNN-and-Naive-Bayes-Algorithms
### Introduction
This project seeks to create a model to predict survival using the titanic dataset. It uses KNN algorithms to achieve this.
The second projects creates a model to groups mails as spam or not spam according to given features.

### Motivation
This project was done as part of an assessment for a Data Science Course to test understanding of Naive Bayes and KNN algorithms.

### Summary of Analysis
1. Defining the Question
2. Reading the Data.
3. Checking the Data.
4. Performing Univariate, Bivariate
5. Modelling
6. Optimizing models
7. Summary and Conclusions.

### Technologies and Software Used
Google Colab

### Languages used
Python

### Setup
The easiest way to run this code is to upload and run it in google colab. Alternatively , if you would like to run it on your local computer you should install jupyter notebook and import pandas and numpy library  and a bunch of other libraries
